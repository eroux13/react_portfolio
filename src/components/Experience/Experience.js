                        <p>Coding Dojo is a full stack development bootcamp that aims to not only teach 3 stacks, but also works to teach participants how to pick up new languages easily. I studied Python/Flask/mySQL, Javascript/Node/MongoDB/Angular_1, and iOS with Swift and Xcode. The program lasted an intense 14 weeks (900+ hrs), and gave me a good understanding of computer science basics as well as a strong knowledge of web development.</p>
